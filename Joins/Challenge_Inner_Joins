Challenge 1 -
1.Find the addresses of the customers who registered.

Solution -
SELECT first_name , last_name , address FROM customer 
	INNER JOIN address
		ON customer.address_id = address.address_id;
    
//If a column name is found on both tables, you can (and should) specify from what table you want to use. EX: address_id is found on both tables
// so we can use customer.address_id or address.address_id
