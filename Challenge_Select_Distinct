Situation  - 
An international visitor isn't familiar with MPAA movie ratings (PG, PG-13 ,etc etc) ; We want to know the types of ratings we have in our 
database.

Challenge - 
Retireve the distinct rating types our films could  have in our database.

My Answer-
SELECT DISTINCT(rating) FROM film;


//
What I learned - 
Using distinct allows us to retrieve unique values from the corresponding chart we are looking at.
Also, ( ) are optional when. 'DISTINCT rating' is a perfectly fine answer
