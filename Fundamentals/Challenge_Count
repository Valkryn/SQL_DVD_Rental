Challenge -
Find how many different payment amounts customer usually pay.

Solution -
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(amount)) FROM payment; // returns 19

//
What I learned
COUNT simply returns the number of rows in a table 
a query like 
COUNT(*)
or COUNT(amount)
would return the same number. 
But in our case, I combined it with DISTINCT which would lower the number since DISTINCT grabs unique values and doesn't count duplicates
