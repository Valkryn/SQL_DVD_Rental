Situation - We want to send out a promotional email to our existing customers!

Challenge - Use SELECT statement to grab the first and last names of every customer and their email address.

SELECT first_name , last_name , email FROM customer;

//
What I learned
the tables dont have to be in order from how the DB has it as; 
I could have said email , last_name , first_name and it would work all the same. 
Using * can be slow depending on hhow big the DB is.
