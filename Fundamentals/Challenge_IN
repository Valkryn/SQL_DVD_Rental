Challenge -
Get the customers whose name are Jake, John ,Jared and Julie

Solution -
  SELECT * FROM customer
	WHERE first_name IN ('John' , 'Jake' , 'Jared' , 'Julie') ;
  
  // The IN operator searches for the provided values.  
 //Alt one could write 	WHERE first_name = 'John' OR first_name ='Jake' OR first_name ='Jared' OR first_name ='Julie' ;
 //But its easier and shorter to use the IN operator
