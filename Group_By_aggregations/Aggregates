Aggregate function take multiple inputs to return 1 output.
Most common ones are AVG, SUM , COUNT , MAX, MIN.

Challenge 1 -
Return the minimum replacement cost in the database.

Solution -
SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film;

//Alternatively you could also say 
//  SELECT replacement_cost FROM film
//	ORDER BY replacement_cost
//	LIMIT 1;
//This method sorts the cost by replacement_cost and limit the output to 1.

Challenge 2 -
Return the maximum replacement cost in the database.

Solution -
SELECT MAX(replacement_cost) FROM film

//Alternatively you could also use ORDER BY DESC

Challenge 3 -
Return the average replacement cost in the database.

Solution -
SELECT ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost),2) FROM film;
//ROUND() function takes 2 parameters ; P1 = the output/value(aggregate) P2= the decimal value we want to round to. ;; ROUND(p1,p2)


Challenge 4 -
Return the total cost of replacing all films in the database

Solution -
SELECT SUM(replacement_cost) FROM film;
